# Lexicon-Trie
Constructs a lexicon trie based on a list of words and has these functionalities:

* add words to trie
* remove words from trie
* finds a set of words in the lexicon that are suggested corrections for a given (possibly misspelled) word that are a user-defined maximum distance from the given word
* finds a set of words in the lexicon that match a given regular expression
